Multiple Linear Regression
Predictive Modeling for Bike Demand of BoomBikes in the American Market
Problem Statement
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

They have contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

# Business Goal
Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

# Prediction Summary:
Train set R-square: 0.83, Test set R-square: 0.80
Small difference between train and test R-square values suggests a good and consistent model.
Probability of F-statistics is significantly less than 0, ensuring model validity.
P-values and VIF of features are within an acceptable range.
Error is normally distributed.
Predicted values are close to the best fit line in a linear regression pattern.
Post-pandemic, demand is expected to be twice next year.
Summer and fall seasons have high demand, suggesting potential profit by increasing bikes for rent and adjusting prices.
Spring sees a rapid decline in demand, recommending discounts during this period.
Weekdays have high demand, while holidays negatively impact demand.
Unclear weather negatively affects demand, advising planning based on weather forecasts.
Lower windspeed is associated with greater demand.
